# Flood-Risk-Mapping
This project involves the development of a GIS-based Flood Risk Mapping and Early Warning System for a river basin prone to seasonal flooding. It integrates spatial analysis and hydrological data to assess flood vulnerability and support proactive disaster management.

Key features include:

-Evaluation of flood-prone zones using topographic slope, land use/land cover (LULC), elevation, and river proximity

-Development of a multi-criteria risk model using weighted overlay techniques to classify areas into high, moderate, and low flood susceptibility zones

-Integration of rainfall threshold data and settlement exposure mapping to formulate an early warning strategy

-Use of GIS tools to generate thematic risk maps, support decision-making, and improve resilience planning

The project demonstrates how spatial data and multi-criteria analysis can be effectively used to model flood hazards and inform early interventions for at-risk regions.
